# Numerical-methods-for-the-Cahn-Hilliard-equation
This repository includes MATLAB code for:
-Five finite difference schemes for the two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation.
-A finite element scheme for the steady-state Cahn-Hilliard equation.
-Functions to compute area integrals using a two-dimensional Simpson's rule.
-Functions to generate animations showing the evolution of the Cahn-Hilliard system.
