# Numerical-methods-for-the-Cahn-Hilliard-equation

Run the script "Example_Script" for a demonstration of the solver, and a pretty simulation.

This repository includes MATLAB code for:
-Five finite-difference schemes for the two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with Neumann boundary conditions.
-A finite element scheme for the steady-state Cahn-Hilliard equation.
-Functions to compute area integrals using a two-dimensional Simpson's rule.
-Functions to generate animations showing the evolution of the Cahn-Hilliard system.
-An example script (called "Example_Script") to demonstrate how the finite-difference code works.
-Some background dependency files called internally within some functions.
